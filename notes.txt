Learning Goals : 
- dotnet CLI
- API Controllers and Endpoints .NET
- Entity Framework
- API Project structure
- Configuration and Environment variables
- Angular refresher
- Dependency Injection in both .NET and Angular

Angular :
- The constructor is normally considered too early to go and fetch data from an API.
So that's why I implement a life cycle event ( interface OnInit ) inside the component.
